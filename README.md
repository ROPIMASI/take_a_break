# take_a_break  

### This project is a python application, for the command line in terminal. It runs a countdown (set by the user) for break time at work or study.  

### The **_"take_a_break.py"_** is a project sample, which I am making to demonstrate some of my abilities. It is also found on my portfolio: https://ropimasi.wixsite.com/portfolio .
