# take_a_break
The "take_a_break.py" is a project sample, which I am making for my abilities' demonstration. It is found also on my portfolio: https://ropimasi.wixsite.com/portfolio .  This project is a python application, for the line command terminal. It runs a countdown (set by the user) for break time at work or study.
